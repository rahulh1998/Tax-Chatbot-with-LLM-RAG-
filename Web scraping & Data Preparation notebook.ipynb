      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Deductions: It is expenses or investments that taxpayers can claim to reduce their income amount. There are various sections in the Income Tax Act like Section 80C, Section 80D, Section 80 G, etc. It lowers the tax liability and encourages saving and investments.\n",

      "What is PAN?\n",
      "A PAN, or Permanent Account Number, is a special 10-digit alphanumeric code given by the Indian Income Tax Department to taxpayers. This number serves as a unique identifier for individuals and helps in tracking their tax-related activities. Whenever a person pays taxes or files returns, they must mention their PAN. Additionally, PAN is shared with banks, mutual funds, and other financial entities. This allows the Income Tax Department to monitor all financial transactions associated with that PAN. Essentially, PAN links an individual’s financial activities with the tax department, making it easier for tax authorities to manage taxation processes and track incomes.\n",

Conversely, non-residents are only required to pay taxes on income earned within India. Determining residential status is crucial and must be done for each financial year separately.

      "A PAN, or Permanent Account Number, is a special 10-digit alphanumeric code given by the Indian Income Tax Department to taxpayers. This number serves as a unique identifier for individuals and helps in tracking their tax-related activities. Whenever a person pays taxes or files returns, they must mention their PAN. Additionally, PAN is shared with banks, mutual funds, and other financial entities. This allows the Income Tax Department to monitor all financial transactions associated with that PAN. Essentially, PAN links an individual’s financial activities with the tax department, making it easier for tax authorities to manage taxation processes and track incomes.\n",

      "What is TAN?\n",
      "TAN, or Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number, is a unique 10-digit alphanumeric code issued by the Income Tax Department. It is primarily meant for entities responsible for deducting or collecting taxes at the source. Any entity involved in tax deduction (TDS) or tax collection (TCS) must obtain a TAN. This number is crucial for filing TDS/TCS returns, making tax payments, and issuing TDS/TCS certificates. By quoting TAN in all relevant documents and transactions, organizations ensure compliance with tax regulations and facilitate smooth processing of tax-related activities.\n",

Conversely, non-residents are only required to pay taxes on income earned within India. Determining residential status is crucial and must be done for each financial year separately.

This number serves as a unique identifier for individuals and helps in tracking their tax-related activities. Whenever a person pays taxes or files returns, they must mention their PAN. Additionally, PAN is shared with banks, mutual funds, and other financial entities. This allows the Income Tax Department to monitor all financial transactions associated with that PAN.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Deductions: It is expenses or investments that taxpayers can claim to reduce their income amount. There are various sections in the Income Tax Act like Section 80C, Section 80D, Section 80 G, etc. It lowers the tax liability and encourages saving and investments.\n",

      "Capital gains income is taxed differently based on the type of asset and how long it’s been owned.\n",
      "Assets are categorized as long-term or short-term based on the holding period, which varies for different assets.\n",
      "Here’s a summary of the holding period, asset type, and corresponding tax rates:\n",
      "Financial Year (FY):\n",
      "The financial year is the period from April 1st to March 31st during which income is earned and reported for taxation purposes. For example, FY 2022-23 starts from April 1st, 2022, to March 31st, 2023.\n",
      "Assessment Year (AY):\n",
      "The assessment year follows the financial year, spanning from April 1st to March 31st of the following year. Taxpayers assess their income earned during the financial year and pay taxes during this period. For instance, AY 2023-24 is for incomes earned in FY 2022-23.\n",

      "What is PAN?\n",
      "A PAN, or Permanent Account Number, is a special 10-digit alphanumeric code given by the Indian Income Tax Department to taxpayers. This number serves as a unique identifier for individuals and helps in tracking their tax-related activities. Whenever a person pays taxes or files returns, they must mention their PAN. Additionally, PAN is shared with banks, mutual funds, and other financial entities. This allows the Income Tax Department to monitor all financial transactions associated with that PAN. Essentially, PAN links an individual’s financial activities with the tax department, making it easier for tax authorities to manage taxation processes and track incomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is TAN?\n",
      "TAN, or Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number, is a unique 10-digit alphanumeric code issued by the Income Tax Department. It is primarily meant for entities responsible for deducting or collecting taxes at the source. Any entity involved in tax deduction (TDS) or tax collection (TCS) must obtain a TAN. This number is crucial for filing TDS/TCS returns, making tax payments, and issuing TDS/TCS certificates. By quoting TAN in all relevant documents and transactions, organizations ensure compliance with tax regulations and facilitate smooth processing of tax-related activities.\n",

      "Residents and Non-residents\n",
      "The levy of income tax in India hinges on the residential status of taxpayers. Residents are individuals who qualify under Indian tax laws and are liable to pay taxes on their worldwide income, including earnings from both within and outside India. Conversely, non-residents are only required to pay taxes on income earned within India. Determining residential status is crucial and must be done for each financial year separately. This classification ensures that tax liabilities are appropriately assessed based on the taxpayer’s presence and economic activities within the country’s jurisdiction.\n",

      "\n",
      "Advance Tax\n",
      "Advance tax is tax paid in advance by taxpayers if their estimated tax liability for the year exceeds Rs 10,000. The government specifies due dates for paying advance tax installments throughout the financial year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Self-Assessment Tax\n",
      "Self-assessment tax is the balance tax that taxpayers have to pay on their assessed income after adjusting for advance tax and TDS. It is calculated based on the total income tax liability determined by the taxpayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "E-Payment of Taxes\n",
      "Taxpayers can conveniently pay advance tax and self-assessment tax online through the NSDL website. However, they need to have net banking facilities with authorized banks for e-payment.\n",
